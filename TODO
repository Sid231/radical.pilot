  + fix invokation frequency of idle callbacks
  + clean pilot cancelation
  + client agent startup
  + exec worker/watcher concurrency
  + lrms/scheduler dependency
  + profile names
  + log file name uniquenenss
  + state history (update ordering)
    + multiple updater instances will compete for state updates and push them
      out of order, thus screwing with the CU states which end up in the DB.\
    + limit to one update instance
  + pilot updates via updater (different pubsub channel)
  + make sure finalize is called on terminate (via atexit?)
  + make sure all profile entries exist, merge from module profiling branch
  + merge from devel
  - merge from osgng
  = forward tunnel endpoint from bootstrap_1 to agent?
  + make sure opaque_slot is a dict
  + make sure that the lrms_config_hook is called only once
    - this is implicit right now(we only have one scheduler instance, and thus
      only one (set of) LRMS instances)
  - At this point it might be simpler to have one LRMS instance which handles
    MPI and non-MPI?  Not sure about the diversity of combinations which need
    supporting...
  = component failures need to propagate to the agent to trigger shutdown
  = torus scheduler is broken in the split arch
  - advance() implicitly publishes unit state, but the publisher needs to be
    declared explicitly.
  + rename 'worker' to 'sub-agent' to avoid confusion?
  - component: collapse declare_input and declare_worker
